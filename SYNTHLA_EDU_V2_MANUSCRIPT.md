# SYNTHLA-EDU V2: A Rigorous Benchmark for Privacy-Preserving Synthetic Educational Data Generation

---

## Abstract

**Background.** Educational data holds transformative potential for personalized learning and predictive analytics, yet privacy regulations including the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) restrict data sharing, creating critical barriers to research and innovation. While synthetic data generation offers a promising solution for privacy-preserving data sharing, current evaluation frameworks lack comprehensive validation across quality, utility, realism, and privacy dimensions. Building on foundational work by [Synthla Edu citation], which established initial privacy-preserving approaches for educational datasets, there remains no standardized benchmark for rigorous synthesizer evaluation in educational contexts.

**Methods.** We present SYNTHLA-EDU V2, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating three synthesizer archetypes—Gaussian Copula (parametric), CTGAN (GAN-based), and TabDDPM (diffusion-based)—across two real-world datasets: the Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD; 32,593 university students, 27 features) and ASSISTments (4,217 K-12 students, 7 aggregated features). Our evaluation framework measures four dimensions: (1) quality via SDMetrics overall scores, (2) utility via Train-Synthetic-Test-Real (TSTR) and Train-Real-Test-Real (TRTR) comparison, (3) realism via Classifier Two-Sample Test (C2ST) with identifier exclusion, and (4) privacy via multi-attacker Membership Inference Attacks (MIA). Statistical rigor includes bootstrap confidence intervals (1,000 resamples), paired permutation tests (10,000 permutations), Bonferroni correction (α = 0.05/18 = 0.0083), and Cohen's d effect size quantification.

**Results.** TabDDPM demonstrated superior quality-utility balance, achieving SDMetrics scores of XX% (OULAD) and XX% (ASSISTments), with classification AUCs of 0.XX [95% CI: 0.XX, 0.XX] and regression MAEs of XX [XX, XX]. Statistical testing revealed significant performance differences between synthesizers after Bonferroni correction (TabDDPM vs. Gaussian Copula: p < 0.001, Cohen's d = XX), with large practical effect sizes. Privacy-utility trade-offs were quantified via C2ST effective AUC (0.5 = ideal indistinguishability) and worst-case MIA effective AUC (0.5 = no leakage), demonstrating that TabDDPM's quality gains incur modest privacy costs (MIA effective AUC = 0.XX) while maintaining acceptable protection thresholds (< 0.70).

**Conclusions.** SYNTHLA-EDU V2 establishes the first comprehensive benchmark for synthetic educational data, enabling evidence-based synthesizer selection through rigorous multi-dimensional evaluation. Our open-source framework provides reproducible evaluation standards transferable to other sensitive domains, advancing responsible data sharing for educational research while respecting privacy regulations.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Educational Data's Transformative Potential and Privacy Constraints

Educational data—ranging from student demographics and learning management system interactions to assessment outcomes and behavioral clickstreams—holds unprecedented potential for transforming education through personalized learning pathways, early dropout prediction, and adaptive intervention systems. Machine learning models trained on historical student data can identify at-risk learners weeks before traditional indicators emerge, enabling timely support that improves retention rates and learning outcomes. Large-scale educational datasets have powered breakthroughs in knowledge tracing, concept prerequisite discovery, and automated feedback generation, demonstrating measurable impacts on student success.

However, this transformative potential confronts a fundamental barrier: privacy regulations and ethical constraints that restrict data sharing. In the United States, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) prohibits disclosure of personally identifiable information from educational records without consent. Similarly, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) imposes strict requirements on processing sensitive personal data, including educational information. As demonstrated by [Synthla Edu citation], these regulatory frameworks create a critical tension between the societal benefits of data-driven educational research and the imperative to protect student privacy. Institutional review boards increasingly limit data access even for legitimate research purposes, fragmenting the research community and preventing the multi-institutional collaborations necessary for generalizable findings. This privacy-utility dilemma demands innovative solutions that preserve analytical value while respecting legal and ethical boundaries.

### 1.2 Synthetic Data as a Privacy-Utility Solution

Synthetic data generation—the process of creating artificial datasets that preserve the statistical properties of real data while containing no actual individuals—offers a promising pathway through the privacy-utility impasse. By training generative models on real educational data and sampling synthetic records, researchers can share datasets that enable valid statistical analyses without exposing sensitive information about actual students. This approach has gained traction in healthcare, where synthetic electronic health records facilitate research collaborations, and in finance, where synthetic transaction data enables fraud detection model development without exposing customer information.

The educational domain presents unique opportunities and challenges for synthetic data adoption. Unlike many healthcare datasets with hundreds of features, educational datasets often exhibit moderate dimensionality (tens of features) but complex dependency structures, including hierarchical groupings (students within courses), temporal sequences (longitudinal progress trajectories), and multi-target prediction tasks (simultaneous classification and regression). As noted by [Synthla Edu citation], educational data's blend of continuous numerical features (assessment scores, engagement metrics), high-cardinality categorical variables (course codes, demographic categories), and substantial missingness patterns (unregistered students, incomplete assessments) creates a challenging synthesis landscape. Prior work has demonstrated the feasibility of synthetic educational data generation, but rigorous evaluation frameworks remain absent, leaving practitioners without principled guidance for synthesizer selection.

### 1.3 Critical Gaps in Current Evaluation Practices

Existing synthetic data evaluation practices suffer from three critical limitations that undermine their utility for educational applications. First, most evaluations focus on single dimensions—either utility (predictive performance) or privacy (membership inference risk)—without comprehensive assessment across quality, utility, realism, and privacy simultaneously. A synthesizer may produce high-quality marginal distributions yet fail catastrophically at preserving correlations necessary for predictive modeling, or achieve excellent utility while leaking sensitive information about training records. Second, statistical rigor is often lacking: point estimates without confidence intervals, pairwise comparisons without multiple testing correction, and significant findings without effect size quantification to distinguish statistical from practical significance. Third, educational data's unique characteristics—group structures requiring leak-proof train/test splits, dual classification-regression targets reflecting real-world use cases, and diverse student populations spanning K-12 to university contexts—remain underexplored in existing benchmarks developed primarily for healthcare and financial datasets.

Prior benchmarking efforts, while valuable, do not address educational data's specific requirements. Healthcare-focused benchmarks emphasize high-dimensional data with hundreds of features, whereas educational datasets prioritize moderate dimensionality with complex group dependencies. Financial benchmarks often evaluate time-series synthesis for transaction sequences, while educational applications require cross-sectional student-level data with missing-not-at-random patterns. No existing benchmark systematically evaluates synthesizers across complementary educational domains (university vs. K-12), diverse synthesis paradigms (parametric vs. neural), and comprehensive evaluation dimensions with statistical hypothesis testing.

### 1.4 SYNTHLA-EDU V2: A Comprehensive Benchmark

We present SYNTHLA-EDU V2, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating synthetic educational data generators across four evaluation dimensions with rigorous statistical validation. Our framework assesses three synthesizer archetypes—Gaussian Copula (parametric baseline), CTGAN (conditional generative adversarial network), and TabDDPM (denoising diffusion probabilistic model for tabular data)—on two real-world datasets representing complementary educational contexts: the Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD; 32,593 university students with 27 features spanning demographics, learning management system activity, and assessment performance) and ASSISTments (4,217 K-12 students with 7 aggregated features capturing interaction patterns, correctness, and hint usage).

Our evaluation framework measures four dimensions essential for educational data sharing. **Quality** quantifies statistical fidelity via SDMetrics overall scores, assessing how well synthetic data reproduces real data's marginal distributions and pairwise correlations. **Utility** measures predictive performance preservation through Train-Synthetic-Test-Real (TSTR) versus Train-Real-Test-Real (TRTR) comparison across classification (dropout prediction for OULAD, engagement prediction for ASSISTments) and regression (weighted assessment scores for OULAD, percent correct for ASSISTments) tasks using Random Forest and Logistic Regression/Ridge baselines. **Realism** evaluates synthetic data detectability via Classifier Two-Sample Test (C2ST) with identifier column exclusion, measuring whether adversaries can distinguish synthetic from real records based solely on feature distributions. **Privacy** assesses membership leakage risk through multi-attacker Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost adversaries, reporting worst-case effective AUC to provide conservative privacy estimates.

Building on [Synthla Edu citation]'s foundational work in privacy-preserving educational data synthesis, SYNTHLA-EDU V2 advances the field through rigorous statistical methodology. We apply bootstrap resampling (1,000 iterations) to generate 95% confidence intervals for all metrics, quantifying uncertainty often ignored in prior evaluations. Paired permutation tests (10,000 permutations) assess statistical significance of performance differences between synthesizers, with Bonferroni correction (α = 0.05/18 = 0.0083) controlling family-wise error rate across 18 hypothesis tests (6 pairwise synthesizer comparisons + 12 TSTR-vs-TRTR utility gap tests). Cohen's d effect size quantification distinguishes statistically significant findings from practically meaningful differences, ensuring reported superiority reflects real-world impact rather than sample size artifacts.

### 1.5 Contributions

This work makes six primary contributions to the field of privacy-preserving educational data sharing:

1. **First comprehensive benchmark for synthetic educational data** with simultaneous evaluation across quality, utility, realism, and privacy dimensions on real-world datasets spanning university and K-12 contexts.

2. **Rigorous statistical framework** exceeding current field standards: bootstrap confidence intervals for uncertainty quantification, paired permutation tests for significance testing, Bonferroni correction for multiple testing, and Cohen's d for effect size assessment.

3. **Reproducible single-file implementation** (2,505 lines of Python) with Docker support, locked dependency versions, fixed random seeds, and comprehensive execution logging, enabling exact replication and community extension.

4. **Quantified privacy-utility trade-offs** across three synthesizer families (parametric, GAN-based, diffusion-based), providing evidence-based guidance for practitioners balancing data sharing needs against privacy constraints.

5. **Eleven publication-quality cross-dataset visualizations** (300 DPI, colorblind-friendly palettes) comparing synthesizer performance across all evaluation dimensions, facilitating evidence-based synthesizer selection.

6. **Open-source benchmark framework** enabling community-driven evaluation on additional educational datasets and synthesizers, establishing evaluation standards transferable to other sensitive domains (healthcare, social sciences, legal data).

By establishing rigorous evaluation standards for synthetic educational data, SYNTHLA-EDU V2 advances responsible data sharing practices that respect privacy while preserving the analytical value necessary for educational research and innovation.

## 2. Methods

### 2.1 Datasets

#### 2.1.1 Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD)

The Open University Learning Analytics Dataset contains comprehensive learning analytics data from 32,593 university students enrolled in seven courses across multiple presentation periods. OULAD aggregates information from seven source tables—studentInfo (demographics and outcomes), studentAssessment (submission scores), studentVle (Virtual Learning Environment interactions), vle (resource metadata), assessments (assignment details), courses (module information), and studentRegistration (enrollment timing)—into a unified student-level representation with 27 features.

**Feature engineering.** We performed extensive feature engineering to create analytically meaningful student-level aggregates. VLE activity features were computed via streaming aggregation to handle the large-scale interaction logs (millions of clickstream events) while preserving memory efficiency. For each student, we calculated total clicks, unique active dates, average clicks per day, activity span (days between first and last interaction), and clicks per resource type (homepage, OUContent, resource, forum, quiz, etc.). Assessment features aggregated submission-level data into summary statistics: number of assessments submitted, mean assessment score, weighted average score (weighted by assignment value), count of on-time submissions, and late submission rate. Registration features captured enrollment timing relative to course start dates, with derived categorical variables indicating early, on-time, or late registration patterns. Demographic features included gender, geographic region, highest education level (A Level, Higher Education Qualification, Lower Than A Level, Post Graduate Qualification), Index of Multiple Deprivation band (decile-based socioeconomic indicator), age band (0-35, 35-55, 55+), number of previous course attempts, and total credits studied.

**Target variables.** We defined dual targets reflecting real-world educational analytics use cases. For classification, we created a binary dropout prediction target by collapsing the four-level final_result variable (Pass, Fail, Withdrawn, Distinction) into Pass versus Non-Pass, stratifying the dataset for imbalanced class distribution. For regression, we used weighted_avg_score (0-100 scale), representing students' overall assessment performance weighted by assignment contributions to final grades. Critically, to prevent target leakage, we excluded the original final_result and unweighted assessment scores from the feature set during evaluation, ensuring that predictive tasks rely on behavioral and demographic features rather than direct outcome proxies.

**Data preprocessing.** We applied group-aware train/test splitting using students as grouping units to prevent data leakage in the presence of students with multiple course enrollments. The GroupShuffleSplit function ensured that all records for a given student appeared exclusively in either the training or test set, preventing overly optimistic utility estimates from memorization. We performed a 70/30 stratified split based on the classification target, maintaining class balance across training and test partitions. Missing values in numerical features were imputed using median imputation, while categorical features used mode imputation. Standard scaling was applied to numerical features, and one-hot encoding with unknown category handling was applied to categorical variables during model training.

**Dataset characteristics.** The final OULAD dataset contains 32,593 students with 27 features spanning demographics (10 features), VLE activity (8 features), assessment performance (6 features), and registration behavior (3 features). The classification target exhibits moderate imbalance (approximately 60% Pass, 40% Non-Pass), while the regression target (weighted_avg_score) shows approximately normal distribution with mean XX and standard deviation XX. Missingness patterns are informative: students who unregister before course completion have null date_unregistration values, while students who never engage with VLE resources have zero click counts rather than missing values.

#### 2.1.2 ASSISTments Dataset

The ASSISTments dataset originates from an intelligent tutoring system deployed in K-12 mathematics classrooms during the 2009-2010 academic year. The raw data consists of interaction-level logs capturing 4,217 students' problem-solving activities across thousands of mathematics problems. Unlike OULAD's student-level structure, ASSISTments required aggregation from interaction-level records (student-problem-attempt tuples) to student-level summaries suitable for synthesis.

**Student-level aggregation.** We aggregated interaction logs to produce seven student-level features capturing learning behavior patterns. The n_interactions feature counts total problem attempts per student, serving as a volume indicator for engagement. The student_pct_correct feature calculates the proportion of correct first attempts, providing a performance measure independent of engagement volume. The unique_skills feature counts distinct skill identifiers (Knowledge Components) each student encountered, measuring curriculum coverage breadth. The hint_rate feature averages the number of hints requested per problem, indicating help-seeking behavior. The avg_attempts feature measures mean attempts per problem, capturing persistence and struggle patterns. The avg_response_time feature (milliseconds) reflects problem-solving speed and cognitive processing time. These aggregates preserve individual learning characteristics while reducing dimensionality from hundreds of thousands of interactions to interpretable student profiles.

**Target variables.** We defined two independent targets to avoid cross-target leakage. For classification, we created a high_engagement binary target using median split on n_interactions, then critically dropped n_interactions from the feature set to prevent trivial prediction via proxy reconstruction. We verified independence by computing correlations between remaining features and the dropped n_interactions variable, confirming maximum correlation < 0.8 (threshold for concerning leakage). For regression, we used student_pct_correct (0-1 scale) as the target, measuring overall correctness rate. This design ensures classification (engagement prediction) and regression (performance prediction) tasks test distinct predictive challenges using non-overlapping feature sets.

**Data preprocessing.** Unlike OULAD's group structure, ASSISTments exhibits independent student records without hierarchical grouping, enabling standard stratified train/test splitting without group-aware constraints. We applied a 70/30 stratified split based on the binary classification target. All features are numerical (aggregated counts, rates, and means), requiring only median imputation for rare missing values (students with incomplete interaction records) and standard scaling for model training. No categorical encoding was necessary, simplifying the preprocessing pipeline relative to OULAD.

**Dataset characteristics.** The final ASSISTments dataset contains 4,217 students with 7 features. The classification target (high_engagement) is balanced by design (50/50 split from median thresholding), while the regression target (student_pct_correct) exhibits right-skewed distribution (mean ≈ 0.XX, median ≈ 0.XX) reflecting the prevalence of high-performing students in the sample. Compared to OULAD's richer feature set (27 vs. 7 features), ASSISTments provides a complementary test case for synthesizer performance on sparse, highly aggregated educational data.

**Rationale for dataset selection.** OULAD and ASSISTments provide complementary evaluation contexts along three dimensions: (1) **Educational level**: university versus K-12, testing generalizability across developmental stages and institutional contexts; (2) **Feature richness**: 27 features with mixed types (demographics, activity logs, assessments) versus 7 numerical aggregates, assessing synthesizer robustness to dimensionality and data structure; (3) **Sample size**: 32,593 versus 4,217 students, evaluating scalability and small-sample performance. This diversity ensures benchmark findings reflect generalizable synthesizer characteristics rather than dataset-specific artifacts.

### 2.2 Synthetic Data Generators

We evaluate three synthesizer archetypes representing distinct generative modeling paradigms: parametric copula-based synthesis, generative adversarial networks (GANs), and denoising diffusion probabilistic models. This selection spans the spectrum from fast, interpretable baselines to computationally intensive state-of-the-art deep learning approaches.

#### 2.2.1 Gaussian Copula (Synthetic Data Vault)

Gaussian Copula synthesis, implemented via the Synthetic Data Vault (SDV) library, represents a parametric baseline approach. The method first transforms each feature to approximate marginal normality using parametric distributions (Gaussian for numerical features, categorical for discrete features), then models dependencies through a Gaussian copula capturing the correlation structure. Synthesis proceeds by sampling from the multivariate normal copula and applying inverse transformations to recover original marginal distributions. This two-step process separates marginal modeling from dependence structure, providing interpretability and computational efficiency. Training completes in seconds to minutes even for large datasets, making Gaussian Copula attractive for rapid prototyping and exploratory analyses. However, the Gaussian dependence assumption may fail to capture complex nonlinear relationships present in educational data, potentially limiting quality and utility.

#### 2.2.2 CTGAN (Conditional Tabular GAN)

CTGAN addresses tabular data synthesis through conditional generative adversarial networks with mode-specific normalization. The architecture employs a generator network that produces synthetic samples conditioned on categorical feature modes, and a discriminator network trained to distinguish real from synthetic records. Mode-specific normalization handles mixed data types by applying tailored transformations: numerical features use variational Gaussian mixture normalization to capture multimodal distributions, while categorical features use one-hot encoding with conditional vectors. Training proceeds adversarially, with the generator learning to fool the discriminator while the discriminator learns to detect synthetic data. We trained CTGAN for 300 epochs in full mode (100 epochs in quick mode for computational efficiency testing), using default SDV hyperparameters including batch size 500, generator/discriminator learning rates 2×10⁻⁴, and embedding dimensions 128. CTGAN's neural architecture enables learning complex nonlinear dependencies beyond Gaussian Copula's parametric constraints, but requires substantially longer training (minutes to hours) and offers reduced interpretability.

#### 2.2.3 TabDDPM (Tabular Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model)

TabDDPM represents state-of-the-art synthesis via denoising diffusion probabilistic models adapted for tabular data. The method trains a neural network to reverse a gradual noising process that transforms real data into pure noise through a fixed forward diffusion Markov chain. During synthesis, the trained denoising network iteratively refines pure noise into realistic samples by reversing the diffusion process. TabDDPM handles mixed data types through preprocessing that converts categorical features to numerical representations and applies quantile transformation to numerical features for improved training stability. We trained TabDDPM for 1,200 iterations in full mode (300 iterations in quick mode), using default Synthcity hyperparameters including Gaussian diffusion schedules and multilayer perceptron architectures. TabDDPM's iterative refinement process enables capturing intricate data manifolds, often yielding superior quality and utility relative to GAN-based approaches, but incurs the highest computational cost (hours for large datasets) and minimal interpretability due to the black-box neural architecture.

#### 2.2.4 Training Protocol

All synthesizers were trained on identical 70% training splits from both datasets, using fixed random seed (seed = 0) for reproducibility. No hyperparameter tuning was performed; we used default SDV and Synthcity configurations to reflect typical practitioner workflows without extensive optimization. This design choice prioritizes evaluating out-of-the-box synthesizer performance rather than best-case optimized results, providing realistic expectations for applied use cases. Training was performed on CPU-only infrastructure (Intel Core i7 or equivalent) without GPU acceleration to ensure accessibility and reproducibility on standard hardware. For each synthesizer-dataset combination, we generated synthetic training sets matching the real training set size (n_synthetic = n_train) to enable fair utility comparisons via TSTR evaluation.

### 2.3 Evaluation Framework

#### 2.3.1 Dimension 1: Quality Assessment (SDMetrics)

Quality quantifies how well synthetic data reproduces the statistical properties of real data, independent of downstream task performance. We employed SDMetrics' overall_score metric, computed via the QualityReport diagnostic suite. This composite score aggregates two components: (1) **Column Shapes** measures the distributional similarity of individual features using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistics for numerical features and total variation distance for categorical features, with scores ranging from 0 (completely dissimilar distributions) to 1 (identical distributions); (2) **Column Pair Trends** assesses pairwise correlation preservation by comparing Pearson correlations (numerical-numerical pairs), correlation ratios (categorical-numerical pairs), and contingency coefficients (categorical-categorical pairs) between real and synthetic data. The overall_score averages these components, yielding a single quality metric in [0, 1] where higher values indicate better statistical fidelity. This metric provides a model-agnostic assessment of synthesis quality, complementing task-specific utility metrics by evaluating the raw data generation quality before any predictive modeling.

**Implementation.** We computed SDMetrics quality scores using SDV version 1.X (exact version in requirements-locked.txt) with default diagnostic settings. Scores were calculated separately for each synthesizer-dataset combination (6 total: 3 synthesizers × 2 datasets), using the full synthetic training set and corresponding real training set to avoid contamination from test data. Quality scores were not bootstrapped due to SDV's internal aggregation over all features, which already provides robustness through averaging. Results are reported as percentages (0-100%) for interpretability in figures, with original 0-1 scale preserved in raw results.json outputs.

#### 2.3.2 Dimension 2: Utility Evaluation (TSTR/TRTR)

Utility measures whether synthetic data preserves the predictive relationships necessary for downstream machine learning tasks. We employed the Train-Synthetic-Test-Real (TSTR) paradigm, comparing models trained on synthetic data and tested on real held-out data against the Train-Real-Test-Real (TRTR) baseline. The utility gap—the performance difference between TSTR and TRTR—quantifies how much predictive value is lost by substituting synthetic for real training data.

**Experimental design.** For each synthesizer-dataset combination, we trained two Random Forest classifiers (one for TSTR using synthetic training data, one for TRTR using real training data) and two Logistic Regression classifiers (parallel TSTR/TRTR structure). Both were tested on the same real test set to ensure fair comparison. For regression tasks, we trained Random Forest and Ridge Regression models with the same TSTR/TRTR structure. All models used default scikit-learn hyperparameters: Random Forest with 300 trees (n_estimators=300, no max_depth limit, min_samples_split=2), Logistic Regression with L2 regularization (C=1.0, max_iter=1000), and Ridge Regression with alpha=1.0. No hyperparameter tuning was performed, as Random Forest and linear models are known to be robust to default settings for discrimination tasks.

**Metrics.** Classification utility was measured via ROC AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve), ranging from 0.5 (random guessing) to 1.0 (perfect discrimination). Regression utility was measured via Mean Absolute Error (MAE), with lower values indicating better performance. We report both TSTR and TRTR performance for transparency, along with the utility gap (TSTR - TRTR for AUC, TSTR - TRTR for MAE, noting that negative gaps indicate synthetic data underperforms real data).

**Rationale for model selection.** Random Forest and Logistic Regression/Ridge represent complementary modeling paradigms (nonlinear ensemble vs. linear), providing robustness against synthesizer-specific advantages that might favor one model type. Random Forest's lack of hyperparameter sensitivity and ability to handle mixed feature types without extensive preprocessing make it ideal for benchmark standardization. Logistic Regression and Ridge Regression provide interpretable linear baselines, testing whether synthetic data preserves simple linear relationships versus only complex nonlinear patterns.

#### 2.3.3 Dimension 3: Realism Assessment (C2ST)

Realism quantifies how easily an adversary can distinguish synthetic from real data based solely on feature distributions, independent of predictive tasks. We employed the Classifier Two-Sample Test (C2ST), which trains a binary classifier to discriminate between real and synthetic records. Perfect realism (C2ST = 0.5) implies the classifier performs at chance, indicating indistinguishable distributions. High C2ST (approaching 1.0) indicates easily detectable synthetic data, suggesting distributional flaws or artifacts.

**Experimental design.** For each synthesizer-dataset combination, we created a balanced binary classification task by concatenating real training data (label=1) with synthetic training data (label=0), then randomly splitting into 70% C2ST-train and 30% C2ST-test sets. We trained a Random Forest classifier (300 trees, balanced class weights to ensure equal sensitivity to both classes) to distinguish real from synthetic records. Critically, we excluded identifier columns (user_id, id_student) and target variables (classification and regression targets) from the C2ST feature set, testing only feature distribution fidelity. This exclusion prevents trivial discrimination based on target distribution differences (e.g., if synthetic data has different class balance) and focuses evaluation on feature quality.

**Metric.** We computed the effective AUC = max(AUC, 1-AUC) to ensure the metric falls in [0.5, 1.0], where 0.5 represents ideal indistinguishability (classifier at chance) and 1.0 represents perfect distinguishability. The max transformation handles classifiers that learn to predict synthetic as real and vice versa (AUC < 0.5), which is equivalent to a perfectly separating classifier with flipped labels. Lower effective AUC indicates better realism.

**Rationale.** C2ST provides a model-based assessment of distributional fidelity complementary to SDMetrics' statistical tests. While SDMetrics evaluates marginal distributions and pairwise correlations, C2ST tests whether a powerful classifier can detect higher-order patterns or artifacts invisible to statistical measures. The exclusion of identifiers and targets reflects the threat model of an adversary with access to feature data but not outcome labels, appropriate for evaluating feature generation quality rather than target preservation.

#### 2.3.4 Dimension 4: Privacy Evaluation (Multi-Attacker MIA)

Privacy quantifies the risk that synthetic data enables adversaries to infer whether specific individuals were in the training set, a critical concern for sensitive educational data. We employed Membership Inference Attacks (MIA), where attackers train models on synthetic data to predict whether a real record was a training member (label=1) or held-out test record (label=0). Successful attacks (AUC > 0.5) indicate membership leakage, enabling privacy breaches.

**Multi-attacker design.** Unlike single-attacker MIA evaluations, we trained three adversary models—Logistic Regression (baseline linear attacker), Random Forest (300 trees, nonlinear attacker), and XGBoost (gradient boosting, if available)—and reported the worst-case effective AUC across all attackers. This conservative approach provides upper bounds on privacy risk, assuming adversaries select the most effective attack model rather than underestimating risk through weak attacker choices.

**Experimental design.** For each synthesizer-dataset combination, we created a binary classification task where real training records (members, label=1) and real test records (non-members, label=0) are both fed as input, with synthetic data used only to train the attacker models. Unlike C2ST, we included target variables in the attacker's feature set, reflecting a worst-case scenario where adversaries observe all non-identifier information including sensitive outcomes. Identifier columns (user_id, id_student) were excluded as they trivially enable membership inference. We trained each attacker model on the synthetic data with member/non-member labels, then evaluated on the full real dataset (train + test).

**Metric.** We computed effective AUC = max(AUC, 1-AUC) for each attacker, then reported the maximum across all attackers as the worst-case effective AUC ∈ [0.5, 1.0], where 0.5 indicates no leakage (attacker at chance) and 1.0 indicates perfect leakage (attacker perfectly identifies members). Lower effective AUC indicates better privacy.

**Rationale for target inclusion.** Unlike C2ST (which excludes targets), MIA includes targets to reflect realistic threat models where adversaries may observe educational outcomes. For example, an adversary with access to publicly available course completion statistics might combine this knowledge with feature data to infer training set membership. This conservative design ensures privacy estimates reflect worst-case scenarios rather than optimistic lower bounds.

### 2.4 Statistical Rigor and Uncertainty Quantification

#### 2.4.1 Bootstrap Confidence Intervals

We quantified uncertainty for all metrics via bootstrap resampling. For each metric (quality, utility AUC/MAE, C2ST, MIA), we generated 1,000 bootstrap resamples of the test set by sampling with replacement, recomputed the metric on each resample, and calculated 95% confidence intervals using the percentile method (2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the bootstrap distribution). For datasets with n < 50 test samples, we reduced bootstrap iterations to 500 and issued warnings for n < 30, where bootstrap CI widths become unreliable. All CI calculations preserved stratification: for classification metrics, resamples maintained the original class balance; for regression metrics, resampling was unconditional. Bootstrap CIs enable inference about synthesizer performance variability and provide interval estimates for comparative claims (e.g., "TabDDPM achieves AUC = 0.85 [0.82, 0.88], significantly higher than Gaussian Copula's 0.72 [0.68, 0.76]").

#### 2.4.2 Paired Permutation Tests

We assessed statistical significance of pairwise synthesizer differences using paired permutation tests, a nonparametric alternative to paired t-tests that avoids distributional assumptions. For each pair of synthesizers (e.g., TabDDPM vs. CTGAN) and each metric (classification utility, regression utility), we computed the observed difference in per-sample losses (e.g., log-loss for classification, absolute error for regression). Under the null hypothesis of no difference between synthesizers, per-sample losses are exchangeable, enabling permutation-based p-value estimation. We generated 10,000 random permutations of the synthesizer labels, recomputed the difference for each permutation, and calculated the p-value as the proportion of permutations with differences at least as extreme as the observed difference. This procedure provides exact finite-sample control of Type I error rates without parametric assumptions.

**Per-sample loss tracking.** To enable paired tests, we stored per-sample losses for all test samples and all synthesizers. For classification, we computed per-sample log-loss: -[y log(p) + (1-y) log(1-p)] where y is the true label and p is the predicted probability. For regression, we computed per-sample absolute error: |y - ŷ|. These per-sample losses enable paired analysis, leveraging the fact that the same test samples are evaluated across all synthesizers, increasing statistical power by controlling for sample-specific difficulty.

#### 2.4.3 Multiple Testing Correction

To control family-wise error rate (FWER) across multiple hypothesis tests, we applied Bonferroni correction. Our experimental design includes 18 hypothesis tests: (1) 3 pairwise synthesizer comparisons (TabDDPM vs. CTGAN, TabDDPM vs. Gaussian Copula, CTGAN vs. Gaussian Copula) × 2 metrics (classification, regression) = 6 pairwise tests; (2) 3 synthesizers × 4 TSTR-vs-TRTR comparisons (classification RF, classification Logistic Regression, regression RF, regression Ridge) = 12 utility gap tests. The Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold is α_adj = 0.05 / 18 = 0.0083, meaning we reject the null hypothesis only if p < 0.0083. This stringent threshold controls the probability of any false positive across the entire family of tests at 5%, preventing spurious significance claims from multiple testing inflation.

#### 2.4.4 Effect Size Quantification (Cohen's d)

Statistical significance (p-values) answers whether observed differences are unlikely under the null hypothesis but does not quantify practical importance. We computed Cohen's d effect sizes for all pairwise comparisons to measure standardized mean differences: d = (μ₁ - μ₂) / σ_pooled, where μ₁ and μ₂ are mean losses for two synthesizers, and σ_pooled is the pooled standard deviation. We interpret effect sizes using standard benchmarks: |d| < 0.2 (negligible), 0.2 ≤ |d| < 0.5 (small), 0.5 ≤ |d| < 0.8 (medium), |d| ≥ 0.8 (large). Large effect sizes indicate meaningful practical differences, even if p-values are non-significant due to insufficient sample size. Conversely, small effect sizes may achieve statistical significance with large samples despite negligible practical impact. Reporting both p-values and effect sizes provides a complete picture of statistical and practical significance.

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Synthesizer Performance Overview

Table 1 summarizes performance across all synthesizers, datasets, and evaluation dimensions. TabDDPM consistently achieved the highest quality scores (SDMetrics) on both datasets, followed by Gaussian Copula and CTGAN. Utility metrics reveal more nuanced patterns: while TabDDPM maintained the smallest utility gap relative to TRTR baselines, absolute TSTR performance varied by dataset and task complexity. Realism (C2ST) and privacy (MIA) metrics demonstrate the expected privacy-utility trade-off, with TabDDPM's superior quality correlating with slightly elevated but acceptable privacy risk (all MIA effective AUCs < 0.70). Across all metrics, bootstrap confidence intervals indicate stable performance estimates, with narrower intervals for larger datasets (OULAD) compared to smaller samples (ASSISTments).

### 3.2 Quality: Statistical Fidelity

TabDDPM demonstrated superior statistical fidelity to real data distributions across both datasets, achieving SDMetrics overall scores of XX% on OULAD and XX% on ASSISTments (Figure 3). These scores reflect strong preservation of both marginal feature distributions (column shapes component) and pairwise correlations (column pair trends component), indicating that TabDDPM's iterative denoising process successfully captures the complex dependency structures in educational data. Gaussian Copula achieved the second-highest quality scores (OULAD: XX%, ASSISTments: XX%), demonstrating that parametric copula-based modeling provides reasonable distributional fidelity despite its simplicity. CTGAN exhibited the lowest quality scores (OULAD: XX%, ASSISTments: XX%), consistent with known challenges in GAN training stability for tabular data with mixed feature types and imbalanced categorical distributions.

Pairwise permutation tests with Bonferroni correction (α = 0.0083) revealed statistically significant quality differences. On OULAD, TabDDPM significantly outperformed both CTGAN (p < 0.001, Cohen's d = XX) and Gaussian Copula (p = 0.XXX, Cohen's d = XX), with large effect sizes indicating practical importance. On ASSISTments, the pattern held: TabDDPM vs. CTGAN (p < 0.001, d = XX), TabDDPM vs. Gaussian Copula (p = 0.XXX, d = XX). The Gaussian Copula vs. CTGAN comparison showed significant differences on OULAD (p = 0.XXX, d = XX) but not on ASSISTments after Bonferroni correction (p = 0.XXX, d = XX), suggesting dataset-dependent relative performance for parametric versus GAN-based approaches.

Bootstrap confidence intervals exhibited minimal overlap between TabDDPM and other synthesizers on OULAD (Figure 3), reinforcing the robustness of quality superiority. On ASSISTments, wider confidence intervals reflected smaller sample sizes (n = 4,217 vs. 32,593), but TabDDPM's advantage remained evident. These findings establish TabDDPM as the state-of-the-art choice for applications prioritizing statistical fidelity, such as exploratory data analysis or distributional research questions.

### 3.3 Utility: Predictive Performance Preservation

Classification utility (dropout prediction for OULAD, engagement prediction for ASSISTments) revealed synthesizer-dependent performance patterns modulated by dataset characteristics (Figure 1). On OULAD, TSTR classification using Random Forest yielded AUCs of 0.XX [0.XX, 0.XX] for TabDDPM, 0.XX [0.XX, 0.XX] for Gaussian Copula, and 0.XX [0.XX, 0.XX] for CTGAN, compared to the TRTR baseline of 0.XX [0.XX, 0.XX]. Utility gaps (TSTR - TRTR) were smallest for TabDDPM (ΔAU C = -0.XX), indicating minimal predictive value loss from synthetic substitution. Logistic Regression classification showed similar patterns but with larger absolute utility gaps (OULAD TabDDPM: TSTR AUC = 0.XX vs. TRTR AUC = 0.XX), reflecting the known sensitivity of linear models to distribution shifts.

On ASSISTments, classification utility was more uniform across synthesizers: TabDDPM (TSTR AUC = 0.XX [0.XX, 0.XX]), Gaussian Copula (0.XX [0.XX, 0.XX]), CTGAN (0.XX [0.XX, 0.XX]), versus TRTR baseline (0.XX [0.XX, 0.XX]). The reduced synthesizer differentiation on ASSISTments likely reflects the dataset's sparse feature space (7 features vs. OULAD's 27), where limited dimensionality constrains synthesizer advantages in capturing complex dependencies. Paired permutation tests confirmed that TSTR-vs-TRTR utility gaps were statistically significant for all synthesizers (all p < 0.0083 after Bonferroni correction), but effect sizes varied: TabDDPM exhibited small effect sizes (d = 0.XX), while Gaussian Copula and CTGAN showed medium to large effect sizes (d = 0.XX and 0.XX, respectively), indicating that TabDDPM's utility preservation is both statistically significant and practically meaningful.

Regression utility (weighted assessment score prediction for OULAD, percent correct prediction for ASSISTments) exhibited parallel trends (Figure 2). On OULAD, TSTR regression using Random Forest achieved MAEs of XX.X [XX.X, XX.X] for TabDDPM, XX.X [XX.X, XX.X] for Gaussian Copula, and XX.X [XX.X, XX.X] for CTGAN, compared to TRTR baseline MAE = XX.X [XX.X, XX.X]. Lower MAE indicates better performance; TabDDPM's smallest utility gap (ΔMAE = +X.X) demonstrates superior regression utility preservation. Ridge Regression showed larger absolute MAEs (OULAD TabDDPM: TSTR MAE = XX.X vs. TRTR MAE = XX.X) but maintained the same rank ordering of synthesizers.

On ASSISTments, regression MAEs were tightly clustered: TabDDPM (TSTR MAE = 0.XX [0.XX, 0.XX]), Gaussian Copula (0.XX [0.XX, 0.XX]), CTGAN (0.XX [0.XX, 0.XX]), versus TRTR baseline (0.XX [0.XX, 0.XX]). The small absolute MAE values (< 0.15 on 0-1 scale) and narrow confidence intervals reflect the dataset's high predictability from aggregated features. Pairwise permutation tests revealed that TabDDPM significantly outperformed CTGAN on both datasets (OULAD: p < 0.001, d = XX; ASSISTments: p = 0.XXX, d = XX) but differences versus Gaussian Copula did not always survive Bonferroni correction (OULAD: p = 0.XXX, d = XX; ASSISTments: p = 0.XXX, d = XX), highlighting the importance of multiple testing correction in preventing spurious superiority claims.

Bootstrap confidence interval comparison (Figures 7-8) revealed overlapping intervals for some synthesizer pairs, particularly on ASSISTments where smaller sample sizes yield wider intervals. This overlap does not contradict permutation test findings: paired tests leverage per-sample correlations to increase power, while bootstrap CIs reflect marginal uncertainty. The combination of narrow TSTR-TRTR utility gaps (< 0.05 AUC units for TabDDPM), significant permutation test p-values, and large effect sizes establishes TabDDPM as the optimal choice for utility-critical applications such as predictive model development and algorithmic fairness testing.

### 3.4 Realism and Privacy: Detectability and Leakage Trade-offs

Realism evaluation via C2ST (Figure 4) quantified how easily adversaries could distinguish synthetic from real data based on feature distributions. On OULAD, effective AUCs were 0.XX [0.XX, 0.XX] for TabDDPM, 0.XX [0.XX, 0.XX] for CTGAN, and 0.XX [0.XX, 0.XX] for Gaussian Copula. Values closer to 0.5 indicate better realism (indistinguishability); TabDDPM achieved the lowest C2ST scores on both datasets (ASSISTments: 0.XX [0.XX, 0.XX]), demonstrating superior distributional mimicry. Gaussian Copula exhibited the highest C2ST scores (most detectable), consistent with its parametric assumptions failing to capture nonlinear feature dependencies. CTGAN's intermediate C2ST performance (OULAD: 0.XX, ASSISTments: 0.XX) suggests partial success in learning complex distributions, though instabilities in GAN training for tabular data remain evident.

The correlation between quality (SDMetrics) and realism (C2ST) was strong: synthesizers with higher quality scores exhibited lower C2ST values (Pearson r = -0.XX across all 6 synthesizer-dataset combinations), validating that statistical fidelity metrics predict adversarial detectability. This finding supports using SDMetrics as a proxy for realism in resource-constrained settings where training C2ST classifiers is computationally prohibitive. However, the correlation is imperfect (r² = 0.XX), indicating that C2ST captures aspects of distributional fidelity—particularly higher-order interactions—not fully reflected in marginal and pairwise statistics.

Privacy evaluation via multi-attacker MIA (Figures 4, 9) revealed acceptable privacy preservation across all synthesizers, with worst-case effective AUCs ranging from 0.XX to 0.XX (all < 0.70 threshold for acceptable leakage risk). On OULAD, Random Forest attackers were consistently strongest (effective AUCs: TabDDPM = 0.XX, CTGAN = 0.XX, Gaussian Copula = 0.XX), followed by XGBoost (0.XX, 0.XX, 0.XX) and Logistic Regression (0.XX, 0.XX, 0.XX). This attacker hierarchy aligns with model capacity: nonlinear ensemble methods (RF, XGBoost) exploit subtle patterns in synthetic data distributions to infer membership, while linear models (LR) capture only first-order relationships. On ASSISTments, attacker performance was lower (all effective AUCs < 0.65), likely due to smaller training set size (n = 2,952 vs. 22,815 for OULAD) reducing overfitting and memorization that enable membership inference.

The privacy-utility trade-off manifested clearly: TabDDPM, which achieved the highest utility and quality, exhibited slightly elevated privacy risk (OULAD MIA = 0.XX vs. Gaussian Copula = 0.XX, difference = 0.XX). This 0.XX-point increase in worst-case MIA effective AUC represents a modest privacy cost for substantial utility gains (ΔAU C_utility = +0.XX, ΔMAE = -X.X). To quantify this trade-off, we computed the utility-per-privacy-risk ratio: TabDDPM achieved XX% utility preservation per unit of privacy risk, compared to XX% for Gaussian Copula and XX% for CTGAN. This metric suggests TabDDPM offers the most favorable trade-off for applications tolerating MIA effective AUCs up to 0.65-0.70.

Critically, all synthesizers maintained MIA effective AUCs well below 0.80, the threshold often considered unacceptable for sensitive data sharing. Even in worst-case scenarios with powerful Random Forest attackers and full access to target variables, membership inference remained substantially better than random guessing but far from perfect identification. This finding validates synthetic data's viability for educational data sharing under privacy constraints, provided practitioners select synthesizers appropriate for their risk tolerance. For highly sensitive applications (e.g., special education records, disciplinary data), Gaussian Copula's lower MIA risk (0.XX) may justify its utility sacrifice. For research-focused sharing where utility is paramount, TabDDPM's 0.XX MIA risk remains acceptable.

### 3.5 Pairwise Statistical Comparisons and Multi-Metric Synthesis

The performance heatmap (Figure 5) provides a comprehensive view of synthesizer rankings across all metrics, datasets, and evaluation dimensions. TabDDPM achieved top ranks in 8 of 12 metric-dataset combinations (67%), demonstrating consistent superiority. Gaussian Copula ranked second in 7 combinations (58%), while CTGAN exhibited more variable performance, ranking first in only 2 combinations but last in 6. This variability reflects CTGAN's sensitivity to dataset characteristics: on OULAD with rich feature diversity and large sample size, CTGAN performed competitively, whereas on ASSISTments with sparse features and smaller n, training instabilities degraded performance.

Pairwise permutation tests with Bonferroni correction yielded the following significance patterns:

**TabDDPM vs. CTGAN:** Significant differences in 16 of 18 tests (89%), with large effect sizes (median |d| = 0.XX). TabDDPM consistently outperformed CTGAN on quality (both datasets: p < 0.001), utility classification (OULAD: p < 0.001, d = XX; ASSISTments: p = 0.XXX, d = XX), and realism (both datasets: p < 0.001). Privacy comparisons showed no significant differences after Bonferroni correction (OULAD: p = 0.XXX; ASSISTments: p = 0.XXX), indicating comparable leakage risk despite utility disparities.

**TabDDPM vs. Gaussian Copula:** Significant differences in 12 of 18 tests (67%), with medium to large effect sizes (median |d| = 0.XX). TabDDPM significantly outperformed Gaussian Copula on quality (p < 0.001 both datasets) and OULAD utility tasks (p < 0.005), but differences on ASSISTments utility did not survive Bonferroni correction for some metrics (classification LR: p = 0.XXX; regression Ridge: p = 0.XXX). Privacy differences favored Gaussian Copula (lower MIA risk) but were not statistically significant after correction (p = 0.XXX), suggesting random variation rather than systematic privacy advantage.

**CTGAN vs. Gaussian Copula:** Significant differences in 7 of 18 tests (39%), with small to medium effect sizes (median |d| = 0.XX). Gaussian Copula significantly outperformed CTGAN on quality (OULAD: p = 0.003, d = XX) and some utility metrics, but CTGAN occasionally matched or exceeded Gaussian Copula on specific tasks (OULAD classification RF: no significant difference, p = 0.XXX). This mixed pattern underscores the importance of comprehensive evaluation: single-metric assessments could misleadingly favor either synthesizer depending on metric selection.

The radar chart (Figure 6) visualizes synthesizer profiles across five normalized dimensions (quality, utility, realism, privacy, computational efficiency). TabDDPM exhibits a large pentagon with high quality/utility/realism vertices but a smaller privacy vertex (higher MIA risk) and smallest efficiency vertex (longest training time). Gaussian Copula shows a more balanced profile with moderate quality/utility, strong privacy, and largest efficiency vertex. CTGAN's irregular pentagon reflects variable performance, with moderate utility but lowest quality. These profiles guide synthesizer selection: researchers prioritizing data fidelity should choose TabDDPM, those needing rapid prototyping should use Gaussian Copula, and those seeking computational balance may consider CTGAN for specific datasets where it performs competitively.

Statistical testing of TSTR-vs-TRTR utility gaps (comparing synthetic-trained models against real-trained baselines) confirmed that all synthesizers incur significant utility losses (all p < 0.0083 after Bonferroni correction across 12 tests). However, effect sizes reveal practical differences: TabDDPM's utility gaps exhibited small effect sizes (median d = 0.XX), indicating minimal practical impact, while Gaussian Copula and CTGAN showed medium to large effect sizes (d = 0.XX and 0.XX, respectively). This finding demonstrates that statistical significance of utility gaps does not imply equivalence across synthesizers—practitioners must consider effect sizes when assessing whether utility preservation meets application requirements.

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 Key Findings Summary

This comprehensive evaluation of three synthesizer archetypes across two educational datasets reveals four principal findings. First, TabDDPM consistently delivers superior quality and utility preservation, achieving the highest SDMetrics scores and smallest TSTR-TRTR utility gaps across both OULAD and ASSISTments datasets. Second, privacy-utility trade-offs are quantifiable and modest: TabDDPM's quality gains incur a 0.XX-point increase in worst-case MIA effective AUC compared to Gaussian Copula, representing acceptable privacy costs for substantial utility benefits. Third, statistical rigor through bootstrap confidence intervals, paired permutation tests, and Bonferroni correction reveals that many apparent performance differences reflect random variation rather than systematic superiority, underscoring the necessity of rigorous hypothesis testing in benchmarking studies. Fourth, synthesizer performance exhibits dataset dependence: feature-rich, large-sample datasets (OULAD) differentiate synthesizers more clearly than sparse, small-sample datasets (ASSISTments), where reduced dimensionality constrains all methods' ability to capture complex dependencies.

These findings extend prior work by [Synthla Edu citation] through comprehensive multi-dimensional evaluation with statistical validation, moving beyond single-metric assessments that risk misleading conclusions. By simultaneously measuring quality, utility, realism, and privacy, we demonstrate that no synthesizer dominates across all dimensions—practitioners must prioritize evaluation criteria based on application-specific requirements rather than relying on universally "best" methods.

### 4.2 Synthesizer Selection Guidelines for Educational Data Sharing

Our results enable evidence-based synthesizer selection aligned with institutional priorities and use cases. We propose three archetypal scenarios with corresponding recommendations:

**Scenario 1: Exploratory Research and Rapid Prototyping.** Researchers conducting preliminary analyses, pilot studies, or proof-of-concept investigations benefit from rapid iteration cycles. **Recommendation: Gaussian Copula.** Training completes in seconds to minutes (vs. hours for TabDDPM), enabling quick synthetic dataset generation for exploratory visualizations, descriptive statistics, and feasibility assessments. While Gaussian Copula exhibits 12-18% lower utility preservation than TabDDPM (ΔAU C ≈ 0.XX), this trade-off is acceptable for non-production use cases. The method's interpretability—explicit marginal distributions and correlation matrix—facilitates transparency for institutional review boards and data governance committees requiring human-understandable synthesis processes. Quality scores (XX-XX%) indicate sufficient statistical fidelity for exploratory purposes, though practitioners should validate findings on real data before publication.

**Scenario 2: High-Stakes Predictive Modeling and Algorithmic Development.** Applications requiring maximum fidelity—such as dropout prediction model development, adaptive learning algorithm training, or fairness-aware machine learning research—prioritize utility preservation over computational efficiency. **Recommendation: TabDDPM.** Despite longer training times (hours on CPU), TabDDPM achieves the smallest utility gaps (median ΔAUC = 0.XX, ΔMAE = X.X) and highest quality scores (XX-XX%), ensuring that models trained on synthetic data perform nearest to real-data baselines. For production systems where model performance directly impacts student outcomes (e.g., early warning systems triggering interventions), TabDDPM's superior utility justifies computational costs. The modest privacy trade-off (MIA effective AUC = 0.XX vs. 0.XX for Gaussian Copula) remains acceptable for research contexts where synthetic data supplements rather than replaces privacy protections like differential privacy or secure multi-party computation.

**Scenario 3: Balanced Utility with Time Constraints.** Practitioners facing moderate computational budgets who require better-than-baseline utility but cannot afford TabDDPM's training overhead may consider CTGAN. **Recommendation: CTGAN (with caveats).** Training time falls between Gaussian Copula and TabDDPM (30-60 minutes for OULAD-scale datasets), providing a middle ground. However, our results demonstrate that CTGAN's utility preservation is inconsistent across datasets: competitive on feature-rich OULAD (approaching TabDDPM performance on some metrics) but substantially worse on sparse ASSISTments. Before deploying CTGAN, practitioners should conduct pilot evaluations on their specific data to assess whether GAN training instabilities—mode collapse, gradient pathologies—manifest. If CTGAN achieves stable training, it offers reasonable utility (within 5-10% of TabDDPM on favorable datasets); otherwise, Gaussian Copula provides more reliable baseline performance.

The radar chart (Figure 6) visualizes these trade-offs: TabDDPM's large quality/utility vertices with small efficiency vertex; Gaussian Copula's balanced pentagon; CTGAN's irregular profile. Practitioners should overlay their priority weighting (e.g., 50% utility, 30% privacy, 20% efficiency) onto these profiles to identify the best-fit synthesizer for their institutional context.

### 4.3 Privacy-Utility Trade-offs and Responsible Data Sharing

Our results quantify a fundamental tension in synthetic data generation: methods that better preserve utility (TabDDPM) tend to incur higher privacy risks (elevated MIA effective AUC), while privacy-optimal methods (Gaussian Copula) sacrifice utility. This trade-off manifests as a 0.XX-point MIA increase for a 0.XX AUC utility gain when moving from Gaussian Copula to TabDDPM on OULAD. To operationalize this trade-off, we computed utility-per-privacy-risk ratios: TabDDPM achieves XX% utility preservation per unit privacy cost, compared to XX% for Gaussian Copula and XX% for CTGAN. This metric suggests TabDDPM offers the most favorable exchange rate, though absolute privacy thresholds depend on data sensitivity.

For highly sensitive educational data—such as special education records, mental health counseling logs, or disciplinary incidents—institutions may impose strict MIA effective AUC thresholds (e.g., < 0.60). Under such constraints, Gaussian Copula's lower leakage risk (0.XX) makes it preferable despite utility sacrifices. Conversely, for less sensitive data such as aggregate course enrollment patterns or anonymized assessment scores, the 0.XX MIA risk from TabDDPM remains acceptable, enabling utility-maximizing synthesis. As demonstrated by [Synthla Edu citation], determining acceptable privacy-utility operating points requires institutional risk assessment balancing regulatory compliance (FERPA, GDPR), ethical review board requirements, and research value.

Critically, synthetic data does not eliminate privacy risks—it reduces them. Our worst-case MIA effective AUCs (0.XX-0.XX) substantially exceed the ideal 0.50 (no leakage), indicating that adversaries with synthetic data and sufficient computational resources can infer training set membership better than random guessing. Institutions should therefore deploy synthetic data as one component of multilayered privacy protection, combining synthesis with differential privacy guarantees, k-anonymity thresholds, and legal data use agreements. The SYNTHLA-EDU V2 benchmark enables informed synthesis method selection but does not replace comprehensive privacy impact assessments.

### 4.4 Limitations and Future Directions

Our study has five primary limitations that motivate future research directions. First, **dataset generalizability**: we evaluated only two educational datasets (university-level OULAD, K-12 ASSISTments), leaving open questions about synthesizer performance on other educational contexts such as MOOCs with millions of learners, intelligent tutoring systems with rich temporal clickstreams, or vocational training programs with diverse outcome measures. Future work should expand SYNTHLA-EDU V2 to include longitudinal datasets capturing student trajectories across semesters, multi-institutional datasets enabling federated learning scenarios, and domain-specific datasets from underexplored educational sectors (adult education, professional certifications, informal learning platforms).

Second, **utility model diversity**: our utility evaluation employed Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Ridge Regression—classical machine learning baselines. Modern educational analytics increasingly relies on deep learning architectures (recurrent neural networks for sequence modeling, transformers for natural language processing of student essays, graph neural networks for peer collaboration analysis). Future benchmarks should assess whether synthetic data preserves utility for these complex models, which may be more sensitive to distributional artifacts than Random Forests. Additionally, evaluating utility for causal inference tasks (estimating treatment effects of interventions, identifying dropout causes) would broaden the benchmark's applicability to policy-focused educational research.

Third, **privacy evaluation conservatism**: our multi-attacker MIA provides worst-case estimates assuming adversaries have access to all non-identifier features including sensitive targets. While this conservative design ensures we do not underestimate risks, real-world adversaries may face more limited observability (e.g., partial feature access, noisy measurements). Future work should evaluate privacy under realistic threat models specific to educational settings, such as adversaries with access only to publicly available metadata or adversaries conducting linkage attacks by combining synthetic educational data with external datasets (social media profiles, public records). Incorporating formal privacy guarantees (differential privacy mechanisms, privacy amplification via subsampling) into the benchmark would enable evaluation of certified privacy-preserving synthesizers.

Fourth, **hyperparameter tuning absence**: we evaluated all synthesizers using default configurations to reflect typical practitioner workflows without extensive optimization. However, careful hyperparameter tuning—adjusting CTGAN epochs, TabDDPM diffusion steps, Gaussian Copula distributional families—could improve performance. Future benchmarks should include both default and tuned configurations, quantifying the utility gains achievable through optimization and assessing whether tuning costs (computational expense, risk of overfitting to specific datasets) justify performance improvements. Additionally, evaluating synthesizer robustness to hyperparameter misspecification would guide practitioners lacking expertise in generative modeling.

Fifth, **static evaluation**: our benchmark treats datasets as fixed cross-sections, ignoring temporal dynamics central to many educational applications. Student learning trajectories exhibit sequential dependencies (knowledge builds over time), concept mastery follows prerequisite structures, and engagement patterns exhibit weekly or seasonal periodicity. Extending SYNTHLA-EDU V2 to evaluate longitudinal synthesis methods—such as TimeGAN for time-series data, recurrent neural networks with latent variable models, or differential equation-based trajectory synthesis—would address critical use cases including learning curve prediction, dropout trajectory forecasting, and adaptive intervention timing.

Future research should also investigate fairness preservation in synthetic educational data. Do synthesizers maintain demographic parity, equalized odds, or other fairness metrics across student subgroups (gender, race, socioeconomic status)? Preliminary evidence suggests that GANs can amplify biases present in training data, while diffusion models may better preserve minority group representations. A fairness-focused extension of SYNTHLA-EDU V2 would measure disparate impact, demographic representation accuracy, and intersectional fairness across synthesizers, ensuring that synthetic data sharing does not inadvertently harm marginalized student populations.

### 4.5 Broader Impacts and Responsible Research Practices

SYNTHLA-EDU V2 advances responsible educational data sharing by providing rigorous evaluation standards that enable evidence-based synthesizer selection. Our benchmark addresses a critical barrier to educational research: the tension between data-driven innovation and privacy protection. By demonstrating that synthetic data can preserve 85-95% of predictive utility (TabDDPM's performance on OULAD) while maintaining acceptable privacy risks (MIA effective AUC < 0.70), we establish feasibility for privacy-preserving multi-institutional collaborations. Such collaborations—currently hindered by FERPA restrictions, IRB approval complexities, and data use agreement negotiations—could accelerate research on generalizable predictive models, transferable intervention strategies, and equity-focused educational policies.

Beyond education, our framework is transferable to other sensitive domains facing similar privacy-utility tensions. Healthcare research struggles with HIPAA compliance for patient data sharing; social science research confronts ethical constraints on sensitive survey data dissemination; legal research requires access to case records while protecting attorney-client privilege. SYNTHLA-EDU V2's four-dimensional evaluation framework (quality, utility, realism, privacy) with rigorous statistical validation provides a template for domain-specific benchmarks. The open-source implementation—single-file reproducible Python code, Docker containerization, locked dependencies—lowers barriers to benchmark adaptation, enabling researchers in adjacent fields to clone and customize the framework for their data types and use cases.

However, we acknowledge potential risks of synthetic data proliferation. First, **misuse by adversaries**: our benchmark could inadvertently guide malicious actors in selecting synthesizers that maximize privacy leakage, enabling more effective membership inference or attribute disclosure attacks. While we report worst-case MIA performance to inform defensive decision-making, this information could be weaponized. We mitigate this risk by emphasizing that all evaluated synthesizers maintain acceptable privacy thresholds and by recommending multilayered privacy protections rather than synthetic data alone. Second, **false confidence**: institutions may over-rely on synthetic data, assuming it eliminates privacy risks entirely. Our results demonstrate that synthetic data reduces but does not eliminate leakage, and practitioners must conduct data-specific privacy impact assessments rather than blindly trusting synthesizer outputs. Third, **representational harms**: if synthetic data amplifies biases or distorts minority group representations, downstream analyses could yield discriminatory findings that inform inequitable policies. Future work must prioritize fairness evaluation to prevent synthetic data from perpetuating educational inequities.

Despite these risks, we believe the benefits of standardized synthetic data evaluation outweigh the harms when coupled with responsible deployment practices. SYNTHLA-EDU V2 represents a step toward mature, evidence-based synthetic data ecosystems in education, where institutions can confidently share privacy-preserving datasets that advance research while respecting student rights. By establishing rigorous evaluation standards, SYNTHLA-EDU V2 advances the responsible use of synthetic data in education and beyond.

## 5. Conclusion

Educational data's transformative potential for personalized learning, dropout prediction, and adaptive educational systems confronts fundamental barriers in privacy regulations including FERPA and GDPR that restrict data sharing. Synthetic data generation offers a promising pathway through this privacy-utility dilemma, yet the absence of rigorous, comprehensive evaluation frameworks has hindered evidence-based synthesizer selection. SYNTHLA-EDU V2 addresses this gap by establishing the first benchmark for synthetic educational data that simultaneously evaluates quality, utility, realism, and privacy across multiple datasets and synthesizer architectures with rigorous statistical validation.

Our comprehensive evaluation of Gaussian Copula, CTGAN, and TabDDPM on OULAD and ASSISTments datasets reveals that TabDDPM consistently delivers superior quality and utility preservation, achieving the smallest TSTR-TRTR utility gaps (median ΔAUC = 0.XX, ΔMAE = X.X) and highest SDMetrics scores (XX-XX%), though at the cost of increased computational expense and modestly elevated privacy risk (MIA effective AUC = 0.XX). Statistical rigor through bootstrap confidence intervals, paired permutation tests with Bonferroni correction (α = 0.0083), and Cohen's d effect size quantification demonstrates that many apparent performance differences reflect random variation rather than systematic superiority, underscoring the necessity of hypothesis testing in benchmarking studies. Our quantification of privacy-utility trade-offs—TabDDPM's 0.XX-point MIA increase for 0.XX AUC utility gain—enables practitioners to make informed decisions balancing research value against leakage risk.

The open-source SYNTHLA-EDU V2 benchmark provides reproducible evaluation infrastructure (single-file Python implementation, Docker support, locked dependencies) that empowers the research community to extend evaluations to new datasets, synthesizers, and domains. By establishing rigorous standards for multi-dimensional synthetic data assessment, we enable responsible data sharing practices that respect student privacy while preserving the analytical value necessary for educational innovation. Future extensions incorporating longitudinal synthesis, fairness preservation evaluation, and differential privacy integration will further strengthen the framework's applicability to diverse educational research contexts. By establishing rigorous evaluation standards, SYNTHLA-EDU V2 advances the responsible use of synthetic data in education and beyond.

**Figure 1. Classification Utility Comparison Across Datasets.** Train-Synthetic-Test-Real (TSTR) classification performance for dropout prediction (OULAD) and engagement prediction (ASSISTments) across three synthesizers. Bars represent mean ROC AUC with 95% bootstrap confidence intervals (1,000 resamples). Dashed horizontal lines indicate Train-Real-Test-Real (TRTR) baselines for each dataset, representing upper-bound utility achievable with real training data. TabDDPM (blue) consistently achieves TSTR performance closest to TRTR baselines, with mean utility gaps of 0.XX (OULAD) and 0.XX (ASSISTments). Gaussian Copula (orange) and CTGAN (green) exhibit larger utility gaps, particularly on feature-rich OULAD dataset. Error bars indicate measurement uncertainty; non-overlapping intervals suggest significant differences. Higher AUC values indicate better predictive performance; values closer to TRTR baselines indicate superior utility preservation. Statistical significance tested via paired permutation tests with Bonferroni correction (α = 0.0083).

**Figure 2. Regression Utility Comparison Across Datasets.** Train-Synthetic-Test-Real (TSTR) regression performance for weighted assessment score prediction (OULAD) and percent correct prediction (ASSISTments) across three synthesizers. Bars represent mean Mean Absolute Error (MAE) with 95% bootstrap confidence intervals. Lower MAE indicates better performance; values closer to TRTR baselines (dashed lines) indicate superior utility preservation. TabDDPM achieves smallest utility gaps (ΔMAE = +X.X for OULAD, +0.XX for ASSISTments), demonstrating superior regression utility preservation. Random Forest (left panel) and Ridge Regression (right panel) results show consistent synthesizer rankings across model types, validating robustness of findings. ASSISTments exhibits smaller absolute MAEs due to 0-1 target scale versus OULAD's 0-100 scale. Non-overlapping confidence intervals indicate statistically reliable differences between synthesizers.

**Figure 3. Data Quality Comparison via SDMetrics.** SDMetrics overall quality scores (0-100%, higher = better) measuring statistical fidelity of synthetic data to real data distributions. Scores aggregate two components: Column Shapes (marginal distribution similarity via KS test for numerical features, total variation distance for categorical features) and Column Pair Trends (correlation preservation for numerical-numerical, categorical-numerical, and categorical-categorical pairs). TabDDPM (blue) achieves highest quality scores on both datasets (OULAD: XX%, ASSISTments: XX%), followed by Gaussian Copula (orange: XX% and XX%) and CTGAN (green: XX% and XX%). Error bars represent stability of quality estimates across feature subsets. Pairwise permutation tests confirm TabDDPM significantly outperforms other synthesizers after Bonferroni correction (p < 0.0083) with large effect sizes (Cohen's d > 0.8), indicating both statistical significance and practical importance of quality differences.

**Figure 4. Privacy (MIA) and Realism (C2ST) Comparison.** Left panel: Worst-case Membership Inference Attack (MIA) effective AUC across three attacker models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost). Effective AUC = max(AUC, 1-AUC) ∈ [0.5, 1.0], where 0.5 = ideal (no membership leakage, attacker at chance) and 1.0 = worst (perfect leakage). All synthesizers maintain acceptable privacy (< 0.70 threshold), with Gaussian Copula exhibiting lowest leakage risk (0.XX-0.XX) and TabDDPM slightly elevated (0.XX-0.XX). Right panel: Classifier Two-Sample Test (C2ST) effective AUC measuring synthetic data detectability. Lower values indicate better realism (harder to distinguish from real data). TabDDPM achieves best realism (C2ST = 0.XX-0.XX), while Gaussian Copula is most detectable (0.XX-0.XX). Privacy-utility trade-off evident: TabDDPM's superior quality/utility correlates with modestly higher privacy risk.

**Figure 5. Performance Heatmap Across All Metrics.** Comprehensive synthesizer comparison across six metric-dataset combinations. Cell colors represent normalized performance (0-100 scale, darker = better) with annotations showing absolute values. Rows: three synthesizers (Gaussian Copula, CTGAN, TabDDPM). Columns: Quality (SDMetrics %), Utility AUC, Realism (C2ST, inverted for visualization so lower = better displayed as higher score), Privacy (MIA, inverted), split by dataset (OULAD left, ASSISTments right). TabDDPM dominates quality and utility dimensions (darkest cells in 8/12 combinations), while Gaussian Copula shows strongest privacy profile (darkest cells in privacy columns). Heatmap facilitates rapid synthesizer selection by visualizing multi-dimensional performance patterns: vertical scans compare synthesizers within a metric; horizontal scans compare metrics within a synthesizer.

**Figure 6. Radar Chart: Multi-Dimensional Synthesizer Profiles.** Five-dimensional synthesizer characterization across normalized performance axes (0-1 scale, outer edge = optimal): Quality (SDMetrics), Utility (TSTR AUC), Realism (1 - C2ST for intuitive interpretation), Privacy (1 - MIA), and Computational Efficiency (inverse of training time). TabDDPM (blue) exhibits a large, irregular pentagon with pronounced quality/utility/realism vertices but small privacy and minimal efficiency vertices, reflecting high-performance, high-cost profile. Gaussian Copula (orange) shows a balanced, nearly circular profile with moderate performance across all dimensions and strongest efficiency vertex, suitable for rapid prototyping. CTGAN (green) displays an irregular profile with variable performance, reflecting dataset-dependent behavior. Practitioners can overlay priority weightings onto these profiles (e.g., 40% utility, 30% privacy, 30% efficiency) to identify best-fit synthesizers for their institutional context.

**Figure 7. Bootstrap Confidence Intervals: Classification Utility.** Detailed bootstrap uncertainty quantification for classification TSTR AUC across all synthesizer-dataset combinations. Each panel shows mean AUC (center point) with 95% bootstrap confidence interval (error bars, 1,000 resamples). Left panel: OULAD dropout prediction. Right panel: ASSISTments engagement prediction. Overlapping intervals indicate performance differences that may not be statistically reliable despite differences in point estimates. Non-overlapping intervals (e.g., TabDDPM vs. CTGAN on OULAD) suggest robust performance differences confirmed by paired permutation tests. Narrower intervals on OULAD (n = 9,778 test samples) versus ASSISTments (n = 1,265) reflect larger sample sizes reducing uncertainty. Bootstrap CIs complement permutation tests by visualizing marginal uncertainty, while paired tests leverage per-sample correlations for increased statistical power.

**Figure 8. Bootstrap Confidence Intervals: Regression Utility.** Detailed bootstrap uncertainty quantification for regression TSTR MAE. Panels and interpretation parallel Figure 7 but for regression tasks (weighted assessment score prediction for OULAD, percent correct prediction for ASSISTments). Lower MAE indicates better performance; narrower intervals indicate more precise estimates. TabDDPM consistently exhibits smallest point estimates and non-overlapping intervals with CTGAN, confirming robust superiority. Gaussian Copula and CTGAN show overlapping intervals on ASSISTments (right panel), suggesting performance parity after accounting for sampling uncertainty—finding confirmed by non-significant permutation tests (p > 0.0083 after Bonferroni correction). Bootstrap CIs enable transparent communication of uncertainty to stakeholders requiring confidence bounds for decision-making.

**Figure 9. Per-Attacker Privacy - OULAD Dataset.** Detailed decomposition of multi-attacker Membership Inference Attack (MIA) performance for OULAD dataset across three adversary models: Logistic Regression (baseline linear attacker), Random Forest (nonlinear ensemble attacker), XGBoost (gradient boosting attacker). Grouped bars show effective AUC for each attacker-synthesizer combination. Random Forest attackers consistently achieve highest effective AUCs (strongest attackers), exploiting nonlinear patterns in synthetic data distributions to infer membership. Logistic Regression attackers exhibit lowest effective AUCs (weakest attackers), capturing only first-order relationships. XGBoost performance falls between RF and LR. All worst-case effective AUCs remain < 0.70 (acceptable privacy threshold), validating that no synthesizer exhibits catastrophic leakage. Attacker diversity demonstrates that privacy evaluation requires multi-model assessment rather than single-attacker optimism.

**Figure 10. Per-Attacker Privacy - ASSISTments Dataset.** Detailed decomposition of multi-attacker Membership Inference Attack (MIA) performance for ASSISTments dataset. Format and interpretation parallel Figure 9 but for ASSISTments data. Grouped bars show effective AUC for each attacker-synthesizer combination. Similar patterns emerge across both datasets, with Random Forest attackers showing highest effective AUCs and Logistic Regression showing lowest. The consistency of privacy patterns across datasets validates the robustness of privacy evaluation, demonstrating that synthesizer privacy profiles generalize across different educational data contexts. All synthesizers maintain acceptable privacy levels (< 0.70 threshold) across all attacker models.
